Creating bots, instagram bots, snapchat bots, bots that'll buy items off whatever website, and programs that will automate the building of those bots, I also want to learn some stuff about ethically hacking, like how to get passwords from Wifi I dont know. Security, and website building are just a few of my other intrests when it comes to coding and prgramming.
